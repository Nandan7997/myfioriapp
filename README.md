File Overview
FormView.view.xml
Implements the main view using XML.
Defines the UI components such as SimpleForm, input fields, buttons, and the output display area.
Technologies Used
SAPUI5 Framework: Provides the controls and architecture.
SimpleForm Control: Used for form layout and structure.
MVC Architecture: Separates the view, controller, and data model for better maintainability.
How to Use
Clone the repository or copy the FormView.view.xml file into your SAPUI5 application.
Bind the form fields to a model (formData) in your controller or manifest.
Implement the onSubmit function in the controller to handle form submission.
Run the application in your SAPUI5 environment to test the form.
Example Data Binding
The form fields are bound to a JSON model (formData). Below is an example of the model structure:

{
  "formData": {
    "name": "",
    "email": "",
    "password": "",
    "gender": "",
    "hobbies": {
      "reading": false,
      "traveling": false,
      "cooking": false
    },
    "country": "",
    "bio": "",
    "birthdate": ""
  },
  "xmlOutput": ""
}
Key Functions
onSubmit
Implement this function in your controller to handle form submissions. For example:

Validate the input data.
Serialize the form data to XML or JSON.
Display the serialized data in the TextArea with id="xmlOutput".
Dependencies
SAPUI5 Framework: Ensure your environment has SAPUI5 set up.

Future Enhancements
